### Objectives:
The objective of this laboratory is to generate an application following a microservices architecture with JHipster, then deploy it using Kubernetes.



### Prerequisites: 
Before proceeding, we followed the installation tutorial: https://github.com/mastering-microservices/tutorial_en/tree/main/install
That maily lead to the installation of:

* Jhipster and Jhipster generator
* Docker + Docker compose
* Heroku
* Kubectl


## Generation of the microservices application
The application generated is composed of:
* JHipster Service Registry:  a microservice registry that helps manage microservices in an application in jhipster
* the API gateway: a component in the JHipster platform that acts as a reverse proxy for microservices
* Three microservices (productorder, invoice, notification)
